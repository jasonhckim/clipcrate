## Overview
ClipCrate respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights as a user.

## Data We Collect
- **User-Added Content**: When you paste a YouTube link, ClipCrate saves the link, video metadata (title, thumbnail), your chosen categories, tags, and notes.  
- **Playback Data**: The app stores your last playback position for each video so you can continue where you left off.  
- **Categories & Tags**: Categories and tags you create are saved locally on your device.  

We **do not** collect, transmit, or store personal data on external servers. All data remains on your device unless you choose to export it yourself.

---

## How We Use Data
- To organize and display your saved videos within the app.  
- To allow you to search, filter, and manage your categories and tags.  
- To resume video playback from where you left off.  
- To enable exporting/importing your library (if you choose to do so).

## Third-Party Services
- **YouTube**: Videos are streamed directly from YouTube using the official embed player.  
  - YouTube may collect data as described in their own [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
- ClipCrate does **not** download or re-host YouTube videos.

## Data Sharing
We do **not** sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties. Your data is stored only on your device unless you explicitly export it.  

---

## Children’s Privacy
ClipCrate is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
